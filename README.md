# What if Brazilian artists painted world-known paintings? 

This work aims to use the so-called Neural Transfer technique, which is based on deep neural nets, to answer the question: what if renowned paintings were made by Brazilian painters?
To do this we will be using the solution developed by Gatys et al. which was implemented using Pytorch by Alexis Jacq.

Foreign artwork includes paintings such as The Starry Night, Guernica, The Birth of Venus, Young Woman at a Window, Lady with an Ermine, The Harvesters, Self-Portrait in Hell, Monalisa,  Seated Nude and A Sunday on La Grande Jatte.

The chosen Brazilian artwork were Abaporu, The Moon, The Lighthouse, Cat, Samba and The Russian Student.

We will essentially apply the style of Brazilian paintings to foreign paintings.
